# Lab 3 - Exercise 4 - Data classification framework

You have been assigned the task of structuring data classification for Contoso Ltd. in preparation for an ISO-27001:2022 audit. The goal is to establish a robust framework that is crucial for ensuring effective data protection against leakage, deletion, and loss. Your role involves integrating a new project ID system for construction projects within the company. To comply with government regulations, all documents that contain a certain project-ID must be kept for 5 years.

You were given following examples to classify Project IDs:

|Project ID|
|----|
|PAR-1023-DA
|BER-0822-AB
|Rom-0419-bm
|sTr*1223-Se
|BaR#0418-ag|
|dui0522-in|

## Part 1: Design a solution (required)

In this task you will design a concept to address the issues Contoso Ltd. is facing.

### Design Approach

This introduction of a new project ID necessitates the creation of a corresponding sensitive information type (SIT), which requires the development of a custom pattern incorporating a regular expression. Subsequently, this SIT can then be used to devise a retention label and an associated auto-labeling policy.

### Proposed Solution

|Requirement|Solution|Action plan|
|----|----|----|
|Identify documents containing project IDs|Microsoft Purview Information Protection|Create a custom sensitive information type|
|Comply with government regulation to retain data for 5 years| Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management|Deploy a retention policy|

## Part 2: Implement the solution (optional)

### Task 1: Create a custom sensitive information Type

You will create a custom sensitive information type to detect documents that contain project IDs.

1. Sign-in to the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal **https://compliance.microsoft.com/** as Allan Deyoung using his administrator account **MOD Administrator**.
1. In the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal, in the left navigation pane, expand **Data classification** then select **Classifiers**.
3. On the **Classifiers** page, select **Sensitive info types** > **Create sensitive info Type**.
4. On the **Name your sensitive info type** page enter following information:
    - **Name**: Project Identification Number
    - **Description**: Identifies project idenditification number
1. Select **Next**.
1. On the **Define patterns for this sensitive info type** page, select **Crate pattern**.
1. On the **New pattern** page, select **Add primary element** and then **Regular expression**.
1. On the **Add a regular expression** page in the **ID** text box, type **ProjectID**.
1. In the tect box **Regular expression** enter the following expression:
```regex   
[a-zA-Z]{3}(\W)?[\d]{4}(\W)?[a-zA-Z]{2}
```
> [!NOTE] The provided regular expression is crafted to identify a sequence characterized by three letters, followed by potentially optional non-word characters, then four digits, followed once again by optional non-word characters, and ultimately ending with two letters. The presence of non-word characters is discretionary, and the overarching pattern is intended to correspond to a specific format or structure within the data.

1. Select **String match** for the **regular expressions** and select **Done**.
1. Select **High confidence** for **Confidence level** at the top and select **Create**.
1. Finish the configuration and create the sensitive information type.

You have successfully created a new sensitive information type to identify project IDs.

### Task 2: Create a retention label

You will create a retention label to retain all documents related to construction projects for 5 years.

1. You should still be logged into the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal **https://compliance.microsoft.com/**.
1. In the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal, in the left navigation pane expand **Data lifecycle management** and select **Microsoft 365**.
1. On the **Data lifecycle management** page, select **Labels** blade.
1. On the **Labels** blade, select **New a label**.
1. On the **Name your retention policy** page, enter the following information:

    - **Name**: Retention of Construction Project Documentation
    - **Description for users**: The construction project cocumentation Retention Policy dictates the retention of all project-related documents for five years following project completion
    - **Description for admins**: This label is applied to retain construction project documents for a period of five years, and it is utilized in conjunction with auto-labeling.

1. Select **Next**
1. On the **Define label settings** page, select **Retain items forever or for a specific period** and select **Next**.
1. On the **Define the retention period** page, enter the following information:

    - **Retain items for**: 5 years
    - **Start the retention period based on**: When items were created
    - **At the end of the retention period**: Do nothing

1. Select **Next**.
1. On the **Choose what happens after retention period** page, select **Deactivate retention settings**.
1. Finish the configuration and create the retention label without publishing it.

You have successfully created a retention label with a retention period of 5 years.

### Task 3: Auto-apply the retention label

You will use the sensitive information type you created in this exercise to auto-apply the retention label.

1. You should still be logged into the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal **https://compliance.microsoft.com/**.
1. In the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal, expand **Data lifecycle management** and select **Microsoft 365**.
1. On the **Data lifecycle management** pane, select **Label policies** blade.
1. On the **Label policies** blade, select **Auto-apply a label**.
1. On the **LetÂ´s get started** page, enter the following information:

    - **Name**: Label documents related to construction projects
    - **Description**: This policy automatically enforces the "Construction Project Documentation Retention" policy on any document pertaining to construction projects.

1. Select **Next**.
1. On the **Choose the type of content you want to apply this label to** page, select **Apply label to content that contains sensitive info** and select **Next**.
1. On the **Content that contains sensitive info** page, select **Custom**, then select **Custom policy** and select **Next**.
On the **Define content that contains sensitive info**, add the custom sensitive information type you created **Project Identification Number**. Then specify the following settings:

    - **Group name**: Project ID lookup
    - **Confidence Level**: High confidence
    - **Instance count**: 1 to Any

1. Select **Next**
1. On the **Policy scope** page select **Next**.
1. On the **Choose the type of retention policy to create** page, select **Static** and select **Next**.
1. Apply the label to all available locatons.
1. On the **Choose a label to auto-apply**, select **Add label**, then select the label **Retention of construction project documentation** you created in task 2 and select **Add**.
1. Turn on and finish the configuration to create the auto-labeling policy.

You have successfully published and auto-applied the retention label to all documents that contain project IDs.
