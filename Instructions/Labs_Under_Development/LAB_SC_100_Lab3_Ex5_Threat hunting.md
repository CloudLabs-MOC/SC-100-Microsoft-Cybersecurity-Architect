# Lab 3 - Exercise 5 - Content Search Microsoft Purview

Your company is facing a serious threat to its integrity and security. A significant number of malicious emails have been detected. Your task is to identify the sender addresses or subject lines of these emails. Once you have identified these malicious emails, you must delete them en masse.

## Part 1: Design a solution (required)

### Design approach

The first step is to identify malicious emails. Therefore, an analysis of the current mail-flow is essential. The Microsoft Defender Portal provides a comprehensive overview of all outgoing and incoming mail flow, along with further capabilities for investigating this traffic. The remediation action involves deleting the malicious emails. 

### Proposed Solution

|Requirement|Solution|Action plan|
|----|----|----|
|Identify malicious e-mails|Microsoft Defender for Office 365|Investigate the mail flow and analyse mail headers|
|Elimination of risks emanating from malicious e-mails|Microsoft Defender for Office 365|Delete malicious mails|

### Task 1: Investigate malicious mails

You will investigate the incoming mails in Microsoft Defender portal and identify which mails are suspicious and contain malicious content.
